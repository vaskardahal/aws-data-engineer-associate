# Amazon DynamoDB

* Fully managed NoSQL Database Service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. 
* Offers Encryption-at-rest that helps to protect sensitive data. 

### Components of DynamoDB
1. Tables, Items and Attributes: Tables are similar to other DB systems. DynamoDB stores data in tables, which is basically collection of data. Each table contains 0 or more items, which is a group of attributes which is uniquely identifiable among all other items. An attribute is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further. 
2. Primary Key: Primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table. It supports a partition key and a partition and sort key. 
3. Secondary Indexes: One or more secondary indexes can be created on a table, that lets us query the data in the table using an alternate key in addition to queries against the primary key. DynamoDB does not require an index, but an index offers more flexibility and performance enhancement when querying. 
4. DynamoDB Streams: An optional feature that captures data modification events in the DynamoDB tables. The data about these events occur in near-real time, in order of their occurrence.  
5. Eventually Consistent and Strongly Consistent Reads: Eventually Consistent means there will be bit of a lag in terms of consistency between replicas. Strongly Consistent means the data will be replicated within milliseconds.

| Optimal Workloads | Ad hoc queries; data warehousing; OLAP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Web-scale applications including social networks, gaming, media sharing, and IoT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Data Model        | Requires a well-defined schema, where data is normalized into tables, rows and columns. All relationships are defined among tables, columns, indexes and other DB elements.                                                                                                        | Schemaless. Every table must have a primary key to uniquely identify each data item, but there are no similar constraints on other non-key attributes. Can manage structured or semi-structured data (like JSON documents).                                                                                                                                          |
| Data Access       | SQL is the standard for storing and retrieving data. Relational DB offers a rich set of tools for simplifying the development of database-driven applications, but all of these tools use SQL.                                                                                     | AWS Management Console or AWS CLI can be used to work with DynamoDB and perform ad hoc tasks. Applications can leverage AWS SDKs to work with DynamoDB using object-based, document-centric, or low-level interfaces.                                                                                                                                                |
| Performance       | Relational DBs are optimized for storage, so performance generally depends on the disk subsystem. Developers and DBAs must optimize queries, indexes and table structures to achieve peak performance.                                                                             | DynamoDB is optimized for compute, so performance is mainly the function of the underlying hardware and network latency. As a managed service, DynamoDB insulates applications from implementations details, so that high-performance application can be designed and built.                                                                                         |
| Scaling           | It is easiest to scale up with faster hardware. It is also possible for DB tables to span across multiple hosts in a distributed system with additional investment. Relational DBs have maximum sizes for the number and size of files, which imposes upper limits on scalability. | DynamoDB is designed to scale out using distributed clusters of hardware. This design allows increased throughput without increased latency. Customers specify their throughput requirements, and DynamoDB allocates sufficient resources to meet those requirements. There are no upper limits on the number of items per table, nor the total size of that table.  |
