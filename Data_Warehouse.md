# Data Warehouse

* Data Warehouse is central repository of structured data from many data sources. 
* Due to its centralized nature, it is the main source of truth for analytical purposes. 
* Data is transformed, aggregated and prepared before it is loaded into Data Warehouse (ETL). 
* AWS provides data warehousing service called Amazon Redshift.
