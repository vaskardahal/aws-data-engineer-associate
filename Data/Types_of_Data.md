# Types of Data
### Structured Data
* Structured data is organized and stored in the form of values that are grouped into rows and columns of a table. 
* Commonly stored in Relational Databases. 
* Highly structured by rules and constraints set within the database itself. 
* Backbone of transactional applications. 
* Around 10% of data. 
### Semi-structured Data
* Semi-structured data is often stored in a series of key-value pairs that are grouped into elements within a file.
* Commonly stored in Non-Relational Databases (No-SQL). 
* Can be stored in CSV, XML or JSON files. 
* Data does not have any structure and any structural format is temporary in nature.
* For example, rules made in online video game, internet browser cache, social apps that automatically delete posts after certain amount of time. 
* Around 10% of data. 
### Unstructured Data
* Unstructured data is not structured in a consistent way. 
* Some data may have structure similar to semi-structured data, but others may only contain metadata. 
* Takes the form of files or objects. 
* Such data requires tagging and cataloging to be analyzed - and this prevents many businesses from using these in their data analysis solutions.
* Data examples: images, email messages, text files, social media content, text messages, videos. 
* 80% of the data worldwide.
