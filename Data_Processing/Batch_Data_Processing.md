# Batch Data Processing


* Batch processing is the processing of a series of programs, or jobs, on one or more computers without manual intervention. 
* Data is collected into batches asynchronously.
* The batch is sent to a processing system when specific conditions are met, such as a specified time of day. 
* The results of the processing job are then sent to a storage location that can be queried later as needed.
